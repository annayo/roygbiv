ROYGBIV : Skills Challenge
==========================

This build script uses Grunt (<https://github.com/cowboy/grunt>), a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.

####  What you need beforehand:

You'll need the following libraries. Project verified with the versions in parentheses.

1. Node (0.8.1)
2. NPM (1.1.35)
3. Compass (0.12.2)
4. Sass (3.1.20)

Download and install node by grabbing an installer from the project site: <http://nodejs.org>. NPM comes along with it.

Install notes for Compass are here: <http://compass-style.org/install/>

Install notes for Sass are here: <http://sass-lang.com/download.html>

####  Installing Grunt:

Simple: "**npm -g install grunt**"

#### Installing Grunt Dependencies:

Each grunt project has a set of dependencies specified in `package.json`.

Install the grunt dependencies by running the following in the build directory:

**npm install**

Then build the project with a simple "**grunt**" in the grunt directory
